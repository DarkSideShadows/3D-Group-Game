# Description of Current Target for the Game:
- First-person multi-level minigame where there are four levels in which the user can experience different majors. Based on SDSU campus. The player can walk into buildings that correspond to an academic program. The goal of the game is to complete all the minigames to ultimately pick your major at the end.

# General Goals for Each Person:

### Justin Iwane
- To create a scene revolving around engineering majors. The player will dodge traps and obstacles such as catapults and landmines to make it past the scene. I'll need to find assets for the catapult, landmines, and rocks being thrown from the catapult. The assets won't be anything too crazy, just ones taken from the internet.

### Abraham Al-Shamsie
- Making the basic player movement where they can walk, run, crouch, jump, and slide. Animating and rigging player’s melee combat, including, punching, kicking, and slashing variations. Implement player’s interactions with objects, like picking up objects, opening doors, hiding in a certain spot, and throwing items. I’ll also try and build a way to transition between levels (scenes) and make a basic main scene to connect the different levels and, potentially, for the player to spawn at (We’re still discussing this part). Implement a basic player stamina, health, and level stats. Maybe if I figure it out in time I’ll try to implement a mini brawl level where the player can experience combat against different bosses from all the majors all at once. Like a huge royal rumble match where everybody is fighting each other in a small area.

### Bryle
- Design an encounter with a Psychology Major. Single room design based on horror aspects: dim lighting, (looping environments?), slightly jarring classroom furniture. Psychology major boss has abilities to manipulate the environment, distort perception, and create hallucinations. Based on increasing difficulty with two/three boss phases. Sound-based attacks and cues.

### Chris Dale Ebuen
- Design a dynamic and engaging combat encounter with the "Art Major" enemy, emphasizing creative mechanics that challenge the player's mobility, vision, and strategy. Incorporate unique attacks and defensive tactics, such as screen impairments, stun effects, and environmental hazards, to create a distinctive boss fight experience. Develop thematic assets that reinforce the artistic theme, ensuring the enemy's abilities and visuals align with the environment and player's actions. 

### Huu-Khoa Nguyen
- Create a combat encounter with a "Buisness Major" enemy. The player will move around a large area trying to dodge an enemy that continuously charges at the player. If the enemy misses and hits a wall the enemy will be stunned for a short amount of time allowing the player to run up and attack the enemy. After a certain amount of HP is lost the enemy will enrage and start to charge more frequently at the player, while maybe shrugging off some of the stuns when hitting the wall. Once the enemy is defeated the level is complete. Will need to find assets mostly just for the enemy as the game is played from the first person perspective.
