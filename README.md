# General Goals for Each Person:

### Justin Iwane
- To create a scene revolving around engineering majors. The player will dodge traps and obstacles such as catapults and landmines to make it past the scene. I'll need to find assets for the catapult, landmines, and rocks being thrown from the catapult. The assets won't be anything too crazy, just ones taken from the internet.
